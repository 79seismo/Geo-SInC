# Modeling fault slip rates using geodetic data

These exercises use one of the simplest geophysical models that can be applied to geodetic data, the 1D dislocation model. This analytical model is quick to compute, has two controlling parameters, and can be used to estimate the slip rates on faults, from deformation velocities measured at a variety of distances from the fault trace. There are examples using GNSS data and InSAR data; the GNSS example is perhaps a little simpler, as we do not need to consider the effect of satellite line-of-sight.
