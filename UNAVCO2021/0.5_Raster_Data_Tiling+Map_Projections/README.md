Raster Data Tiling + Map Projections

Resource: Raster Data Manipulation Video and Map Projection Video linked on syllabus

Expected Outcome: Develop an understanding of manipulation of raster image data and their metadata, including the reasons data sets are projected in different ways to better capture a particular aspect of a spherical data set represented in a 2-dimensional space, most important projections, how to transform between projections.

Assessment: In class manipulation of tiled data converting between specified projections in a notebook.
