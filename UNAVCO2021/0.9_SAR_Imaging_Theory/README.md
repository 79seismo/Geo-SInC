# SAR Imaging Theory
2021 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Paul Rosen, David Bekaert, Heresh Fattahi, Gareth Funning, Franz Meyer, Brent Minchew, Hilarie Deavis, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Shubham Awasthi, Faizan Sabir, Luyen Bui, Pratyusha Gonnuru, Becca Bussard

ISCE Version: v2.5.2

MintPy Version: v1.3.1

Resource: SAR_Processor.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Students learn the basics of SAR imaging by processing an image step by step from simulated raw data to full imagery using range-doppler and backprojection focusing methods.

Assessment: Alter some parameter and plot final impulse response; student needs to figure out which parameter based on problem
