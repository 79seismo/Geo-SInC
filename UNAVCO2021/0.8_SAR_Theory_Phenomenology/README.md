# SAR Theory Phenomenology
2021 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Paul Rosen, David Bekaert, Heresh Fattahi, Gareth Funning, Franz Meyer, Brent Minchew, Hilarie Deavis, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Shubham Awasthi, Faizan Sabir, Luyen Bui, Pratyusha Gonnuru, Becca Bussard

ISCE Version: v2.5.2

MintPy Version: v1.3.1

Resource: SAR.ipynb 

Expected Outcome: Students learn the basics of phenomenology, including speckle, radar equation, wavelength dependence, polarization, layover, shadow 

Assessment: Exercises to alter the notebooks provided to look for specific results (e.g. speckle filtering, processing bandwidth, radar equation changes of range, etc.).
