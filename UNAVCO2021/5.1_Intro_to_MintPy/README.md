# Intro to MintPy
2021 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Paul Rosen, David Bekaert, Heresh Fattahi, Gareth Funning, Franz Meyer, Brent Minchew, Hilarie Deavis

TAâ€™s: Shubham Awasthi, Faizan Sabir, Luyen Bui, Pratyusha Gonnuru, Becca Bussard

ISCE Version: v2.5.2

MintPy Version: v1.3.1

Resource: smallbaselineApp_aria.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Develop an understanding of the capabilities of MintPy, expected inputs and possible outputs, and control parameters

Assessment: Final project that brings together everything in previous lectures, including a time series analysis using MintPy, followed by an inversion of a specific model for one or two interferograms in the stack.  Could pick something like a dyke intrusion event, and analyze nearest pair and other pairs spanning the event and see how the models differ.
