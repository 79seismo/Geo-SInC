# Tropo + Ionosphere + Split Spectrum
2021 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Paul Rosen, David Bekaert, Heresh Fattahi, Gareth Funning, Franz Meyer, Brent Minchew, Hilarie Davis, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Shubham Awasthi, Faizan Sabir, Luyen Bui, Pratyusha Gonnuru, Becca Bussard

ISCE Version: v2.5.2

MintPy Version: v1.3.1

Resource: stripmapApp_ionosphere.ipynb, Tropo.ipynb

Expected Outcome: Develop and understanding of the typical signatures of the troposphere and ionosphere in InSAR data, its spatial and temporal variability, wavelength dependence (or not), ways to estimate or model, and expected improvements.

Assessment: Execute the self-directed notebook and inspect the result
