# Offset stack for velocity dynamics
2021 InSAR Processing and Time-Series Analysis for Geophysical Applications: ISCE, ARIA-Tools, and MintPy

Instructors: Paul Rosen, David Bekaert, Heresh Fattahi, Gareth Funning, Franz Meyer, Brent Minchew, Hilarie Davis, Zhang Yunjun

TAâ€™s: Shubham Awasthi, Faizan Sabir, Luyen Bui, Pratyusha Gonnuru, Becca Bussard

ISCE Version: v2.5.2

MintPy Version: v1.3.1

Resource: Module resources

Expected Outcome: Use a stack of interferograms or offset fields to infer a multi-dimensional (2D or 3D) velocity time-series. We will cover some methods for separating velocity components, separating short and long timescales, and quantifying uncertainties.

Assessment: Execute the self-directed notebook and respond to prompts
